Logo Usage
========================

We proudly share the `PyCytoData` logo with the community. In fact, in lieu of an MIT license
that governs the codebase, it is useful to spell out acceptale uses of our logo. In general,
we encourage the use of our logo in the community so that this package may reach a wide audience,
which benefits everyone. At the same time, we wish our logo to be uniquely associated with our
software. Therefore, the logo is licensed under the **CC-BY-ND 4.0** license.

Some examples of encourged PyCytoData Logo usage:

* Your software uses PyCytoData.
* Your software is compatible with PyCytoData.
* Your paper cites any of the papers associated with PyCytoData.
* You are talking about PyCytoData.
* You like PyCytoData.

There are endlessly more situations in which our logo can be displayed.

However, in the case that your software is a derivative work of PyCytoData, please refrain from using
the current logo as your main logo, which may cause confusion. You are still welcomed to include
the logo to promote PyCytoData.

.. note::

    Unless otherwise noted, we in general do not specifically endorse, certify, or in any capacity vet software, website,
    paper, threads, or any other medium that display the PyCytoData logo. Please refer to our official
    documentation page for official updates.
