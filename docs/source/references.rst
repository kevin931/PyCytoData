If you use ``PyCytoData`` to perform DR, citing the [our DR Review paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.26.489549) is highly appreciated:

```

If you use the builtin datasets (``levine13``, ``levine32``, ``samusik``), you can cite the following papers
along with ``HDCytoData``, which hosts these datasets.
